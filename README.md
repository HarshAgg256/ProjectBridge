# ProjectBridge
An interactive application to automate and streamline the project application process at the University

# Overview

The current work system for managing project type courses at our university is manual and
 inefficient. Professors submit their project lists to the admission division, which compiles them
 into a PDF document and sends it to students via email. Students then email professors
 individually to express their interest in specific projects. However, this system faces several
 challenges and limitations.<br>
 One major problem is the lack of transparency regarding the maximum number of students
 professors are willing to accept for their projects. Students are unaware of the available slots,
 leading to confusion and miscommunication. As a result, students may apply for projects that
 are already full or fail to find enough applicants to fill a project.<br>
 Another issue is the time-consuming process faced by professors in managing and organizing
 the numerous emails they receive from students. The absence of a standardized template
 makes it difficult for professors to locate relevant information, such as CGPA and prerequisite
 course details. This inefficiency hinders timely evaluation and response to student applications.
 To address these challenges, we propose the development of "Project Bridge" an application
 system designed to automate and streamline the process of applying for project type courses.
 The aim of Project Bridge is to provide a more efficient and transparent experience for both
 students and professors.<br>
 The proposed application system will empower professors to create and manage their project
 profiles within the system. They can specify project details like the title, description, eligibility
 criteria, and the maximum number of students they are willing to accept. This information will be
 readily available to students, enabling them to make informed decisions when selecting
 projects.<br>
 Students will have access to a user-friendly dashboard displaying the project list, available slots,
 and eligibility criteria. They can easily apply for projects directly through the system, eliminating
 the need for individual emails. Moreover, a standardized template will be provided to students
 for providing additional information, such as a paragraph explaining their suitability for a specific
 project.<br>
 Project Bridge will facilitate seamless communication between students and professors.
 Professors can efficiently review and manage student applications within the system,
 streamlining the evaluation process. The system will also provide notifications and alerts to
 ensure timely responses and updates for both parties.
